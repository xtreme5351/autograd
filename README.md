# autograd engine
This is a small hand-made autograd engine, very loosely inspired by Karpathy's micrograd.

Lowk more than anything, this is an exercise to understand how autograd engines work in practice, implementing what was taught in class and reading various posts on the topic, also continuining from my autodiff/autograd CUDA work
